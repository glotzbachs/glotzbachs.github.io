Project one.. Complete!

Although I began this project a little nervous about what was to come, it wasn't as bad as I expected. The hardest part wasn't even what I had anticipated. I figured the main piece of the project (scraping, coding, itterating, and connecting the files) was going to be tough. But nope.. First, I couldn't find a website that fit the requirements of this lab and was something I was actually interested in. Then, once I finally settled on a website, the next step, was just as difficult. Making and connecting the files to put all the code in was something we've never had to do, which made it difficult. Luckily we have plenty of resources to help! Once that was done, the rest was honestly not too bad.  Every piece of the project had come up in a lab prior to the start. This project was mostly just connecting it all together. As with all beginner coders, there was the occasional hiccup, but that's to be expected. Someone like me.. I mostly just need to stay focused on watching out for the stupid typos. Much like in math, precision is just as important as the content. You can know every step of how to solve, derive, or integrate the hardest equations, but if you forget to transfer a negative from one step to the next, you are more than likely not getting the right answer. In coding, you forget one letter, mistype one word, or forget what seems like a silly punctuation mark, and your whole code will break. Luckily, even without having to get our tests to pass, we have the amazing tools of Pry to help us find the issues in our code. I think one of the biggest parts of this journey for me is going to be gaining precision along with the immense amounts of knowledge. By the end, silly mistakes will be a thing of the past. Hopfully..
