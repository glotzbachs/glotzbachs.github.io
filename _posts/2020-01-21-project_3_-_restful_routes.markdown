Throughout both the Rails and Sinatra sections of this class, I was consistently taught to use RESTful routes. At first, I wasn't really sure why it was so important to maintain these routes, but the more I worked through the labs and projects, the clearer it became. It became much clearer once I began working with Rails. Rails obviously was written with the intention  of using RESTful routes. It is most clear when you begin creating the routes themselves in routes.rb. When you add a resource, it automatically generates all of the RESTful routes without having to specify which routes you are talking about. It’s extremely helpful because it saves a lot of time when you know you are going to be using each route automatically given by the resource. 

RESTful routes are also extremely helpful in maintaining the uniformity amongst programmers and their codes. I am sure this will become more obvious when I start working with other programmer’s and their code. Since using RESTful routes is expected, it makes the code more easy to navigate and fix if it’s the first time you’re seeing it and working with it. If RESTful routes aren’t used in the development of the app, it would make it more difficult for another programmer to look at and work with your code. After completing this project, I am sure I will continue to use RESTful routes in any programs I create as I continue this program and join the world of programming.
