I have really enjoyed learning about React because it took the front end capabilities of JS and made them easier to access and overall code. When using JS, each element on the page needs to be grabbed individually in order for it to be changed or updated. React has completely taken that away. Each component handles it's information seperately without having to gain access to a different component for alteration. No more innerhtml += or getElementById. React allows for simple component rendering, passing props, and changing state, which was even further simplified by Redux.

When I first started learning about Redux, the overall feelings I got from other people was that it was not very well liked. The issue being that the set up is too tedious for what it does. Now that I've been working with it for a while, I would have to say I disagree. What wasn't made clear by those who seemed to dislike it is the fact that isn't necessary for smaller apps. I say, just don't waste your time with it when  the app is smaller and doesn't need to utilize its benefits. When working with bigger apps, it definitely makes moving information around so much easier, and possible. I definitely think it's worth the set up. Without redux, keeping track of state becomes extremely difficult, and at times even impossible. Redux allows for state to be held at the top level of the app which can then be accessed anywhere else when called. Could it maybe made easier to set up? Sure.. But look how far JS has come and how much more difficult React would be without it. I'm thankful we have anything to hold state at all.
