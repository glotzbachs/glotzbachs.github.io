I think of all the projects, I felt most scared starting this one. I was afraid the curriculum had not prepared me as well as I needed to be successful. Luckily, I have a great support in my cohort. Top of the list, Nancy Noyes! She has been an extraordinary help throughout this entire course, and I'm not sure what I would have done without her. 

JavaScript was a whole new world. The curriculum was set up differently, and it was the first time we had jumped away from using Ruby or a Ruby-based language. It was difficult working through the curiculum, but it was definitely helpful in terms of learning how to learn on our own, which will be extremely important once we get in to the real world of coding. Once we graduate FlatIron, we will no longer have an entire support system backing us up. We will have our coworkers, but other than that we will need to turn to our best friend, Google. Most of the programming languages we use will have similar functionality, but they will have have their own syntax. We aren't, nor could be, expected to know the syntax of every language we will ever use. Some we may use haven't even been developed yet. Being able to search how to best use each language is a skill that will be necessary in our careers. So for that, I'm thankful this section was different from the rest. I know that what I have learned in this section will help me in the next section, React, as the syntax has a lot of similarities. I'm glad I got the oportunity to learn JavaScript and I'm sure it will be useful in my career, but I look forward to moving forward and being able to utilize all of the knowledge I have received from this section.
